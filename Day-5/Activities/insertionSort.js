//? INSERTION SORT

//* Write a function that takes in an array and uses the insertion sort method to sort the array from smallest to biggest

//@ Hint #1: You will be swapping values, but you do not need to use the swapping helper function to do this

//@ Hint #2: this can be done using a while loop OR a nested for loop. 

//@ Hint #3: If you are using a nested for loop, there may be scoping issues that develop depending how you plan to swap the values after the second for-loop has completed. Because of this, we recommend using the "var" keyword instead of "let" to define your inner looping variable (i.e. --> for (var j = ...; j < ...; j--))

function insertionSort(arr) {
    
}

console.log(insertionSort([15,4,13,2,11]));
//* Expected Result: [2,4,11,13,15]
