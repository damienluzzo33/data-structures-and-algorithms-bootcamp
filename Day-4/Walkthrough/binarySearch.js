//? BINARY SEARCH

//* Create a function that accepts a sorted array (important) of integers and a value that is also an integer, and returns the index at which the value was found in the array, otherwise we return -1 if the value was not found. 

//* We are going to use the divide and conquer method to drastically reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.

//* How can we find the middle point of the array?

//* How can we determine which side of the mid point that we should continue our search in?

//* What happens when the value is found in the array? How do we keep track of its index?

//* What is our terminating condition to stop the search and return -1 if it's not found?
