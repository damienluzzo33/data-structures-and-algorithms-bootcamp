//? NAIVE STRING SEARCH

//* Create a function called naiveSearch that accepts a long string called "text" and a shorter string called "pattern" that should return the total number of times that the pattern is found in the text. 

//* What are the steps involved with solving this problem? 

//* How do we test if the values match?

//* What do we do once our loops identify a match?

//* What is it that we are looking to return in the end? How to we keep track of that?
