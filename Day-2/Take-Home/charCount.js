//? FREQUENCY COUNTER

//*  Write a function that takes in a string and counts the amount of characters in the string. 
//*  Returns an object that holds the count for each character in the inputted string.

//*  Hint: Use the frequency counter pattern to keep Time Complexity to O(N)!

//*  Declare any parameters you deem necessary

//*  EXAMPLES:
//*  "pizza"  -->  { p: 1, i: 1, z: 2, a: 1 }

function charCount() {
