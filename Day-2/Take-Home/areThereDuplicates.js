//?  MULTIPLE POINTERS

//*  Implement a function called, areThereDuplicates which accepts a variable number of arguments, and checks whether there are any duplicates among the arguments passed in
//*  Can solve this using either Frequency Counter or Multiple Pointers
//*  variable number of arguments means to use the built-in argument object in javascript
//*  if using multiple pointers the array must be sorted first!

//*  By variable number of arguments, search up the arguments object on MDN! https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/arguments


//*  Frequency Counter Approach
//*  HINT: Do we need to declare parameters?

function areThereDuplicates() {

}


//*  Multiple Pointers Approach
//*  HINT: What must the array be before you can use multiple pointers?
//*  HINT: Where should you start your multiple pointers?

function areThereDuplicates() {
    
}


//*  BONUS: Can you solve this algorithm in one line?
