// Write code to create a function that returns the factorial of `num`

// What is being asked?
// What inputs are being given?
// Are there any edge cases we have to worry about?
// What should the output be?
// What have we done that seems similar to this?
// Solve/Simplify
// Look back/Refactor, how can we solve this differently but just as efficiently?
