//*  Create a function called "maxSum" that accepts an two inputs: one that is an array of positive integers and a second one that is just an integer. The function should return the maximum sum of consecutive integers based on the second input that is passed in.

//*  Test Cases:
//*  maxSum( [50, 100, 150, 200, 250], 3 ) --> 600
//*  maxSum( [51, 12, 10, 16, 92], 4 ) --> 130
//*  maxSum( [1, 6, 10, 3, 5], 3 ) --> 19

//*  What is being asked here?
//*  What types of inputs are we using?
//*  Are there any edge cases we have to look out for?
//*  What should the output be?
//*  What are we keeping track of?
//*  Break it down, pseudo code it, and solve it
