//*  Write a function that takes in an integer and returns fizz buzz if it is divisible by 3 and 5,
//*  fizz if it is divisible by 3,
//*  buzz if it is divisible by 5,
//*  or the integer itself if it is not divisible by any


//*  What is being asked?
//*  What inputs are being given?
//*  Are there any edge cases we have to worry about?
//*  What should the output be?
//*  What have we done that seems similar to this?
//*  Solve/Simplify
//*  Look back/Refactor, can we solve this differently but just as efficiently?
