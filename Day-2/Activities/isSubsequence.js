//?  MULTIPLE POINTERS

//*  Write a function called isSubsequence which takes in two strings and checks whether the characters in the first string form a subsequence of the characters in the second string. 
//*  In other words, the function should check whether the characters in the first string appear somewhere in the second string, without their order changing.
//*  function will take in 2 strings
//*  it will do a comparison to make sure one string is a substring of the other


function isSubsequence(mainString, subString) {
    // TODO: Account for the edge case of the main string being empty

    // TODO: Create pointers that start at the beginning of both strings
    
    // TODO: Catch the edge case of if the substring string inputted was empty
    

    // TODO: Continue looping as long as the main string pointer doesn't reach the end of the main string
    while () {
        // TODO: If the characters are the same at the current pointers of each string, move the pointer on the substring
        
        // TODO: If the pointer on the substring reaches the end of the substring return true
        
        // TODO: increment the pointer on the main string

    // TODO: if while loop was finished what is returned here?
