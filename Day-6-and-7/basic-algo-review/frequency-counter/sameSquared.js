//?  FREQUENCY COUNTER

//*  Write a function called same, which accepts two arrays. The function should return true if every value in the array has its corresponding value squared in the second array. The frequency of values must be the same. 

//*  Test cases:
//*  same([1,2,3,4], [1,4,9,16]) resolves as true
//*  same([1,2,3,4], [1,3,5,25]) resolves as false



function same(arr1, arr2) {
    // TODO: What edge case should be accounted for here?

    // TODO: Declare your frequency counters
    
    // TODO: for each value in the first array
    for () {
    
        // TODO: Count each value in arr, and increase the counter for each value
        
    }

    // TODO: for each value in the second array
    for () {
    
        // TODO: Count each value in arr2, and increase the counter for each value
        
    }

    // TODO: Loop over the keys in one frequency counter
    for () {
        
        // TODO: Check to see if the same key in one frequency counter is squared in the other frequency counter
        if () {
            // TODO: if not return false
        }

        // TODO: Check to see if the squared key has the same counter value as the corresponding key in the other counter
        if () {
            // TODO: if not return false
        }
        
    }
    
    // TODO: if we make it this far, what are we returning?
