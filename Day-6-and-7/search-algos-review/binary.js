//? BINARY SEARCH

//* Create a function that accepts a sorted array (important) of integers and a value that is also an integer, and returns the index at which the value was found in the array, otherwise we return -1 if the value was not found. Use the divide and conquer method to drastically reduce the time complexity of the algorithm.
